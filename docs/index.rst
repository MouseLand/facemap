Facemap
===================================
Facemap is a framework for predicting neural activity from mouse orofacial movements. It includes a pose estimation model for tracking distinct keypoints on the mouse face, a neural network model for predicting neural activity using the pose estimates, and also can be used compute the singular value decomposition (SVD) of behavioral videos.
